Algorithm Name: Dynamic Polymorphic Web Security Algorithm (DPWSA)
Creator: Benjamin Hunter Miller

Description:
The Dynamic Polymorphic Web Security Algorithm (DPWSA) is an advanced web security algorithm designed to protect websites from a wide range of cyber-attacks, including SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), man-in-the-middle attacks, and brute force attacks. What makes DPWSA unique is its polymorphic approach, where the algorithm continuously changes key security elements (e.g., encryption keys, access tokens, HTML structures) dynamically during a session, making it extremely difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities through static analysis or replay attacks.

By introducing constant variation in key elements of the website’s security infrastructure and adapting based on threat detection, DPWSA significantly raises the bar for attackers trying to gain unauthorized access or inject malicious code into the system.

Key Features:
Polymorphic Encryption Keys: Regularly rotates and regenerates encryption keys used for secure communications (e.g., SSL/TLS certificates, session tokens) in real time, preventing attackers from leveraging compromised keys.
Dynamic HTML and JavaScript Structure: The algorithm dynamically changes the structure of HTML elements and JavaScript code with each page load to thwart static code analysis and automated attacks like XSS and script injection.
Real-Time Threat Detection and Response: Uses real-time monitoring and AI-driven anomaly detection to identify suspicious patterns (e.g., unusual login attempts, request floods) and adjusts security measures dynamically (e.g., throttling, IP blocking, security token resets).
Contextual Session Management: Dynamically alters session cookies and tokens based on user behavior, device, and location, making it difficult for attackers to hijack sessions or reuse stolen tokens.
Polymorphic CAPTCHA: Generates evolving, user-specific CAPTCHA challenges based on user behavior and system feedback, increasing difficulty for bots and automated scripts.
Adaptive Hashing for Passwords: Constantly adjusts the hashing algorithm (e.g., salting and stretching methods) used for password storage, ensuring that even if the hashing method is compromised, it becomes irrelevant after a short period.
AI-Driven Anomaly-Based Authentication: Incorporates machine learning to analyze user activity patterns, and if an anomaly is detected (e.g., login from a suspicious location or device), the algorithm adjusts authentication methods in real time.
How It Works:
1. Polymorphic Encryption:
Rotating Encryption Keys: The algorithm regularly rotates the encryption keys used for SSL/TLS and other secure communications during a session. This prevents an attacker from using a compromised key for an extended period. Each session or sensitive operation (e.g., login, transactions) triggers the generation of a new keypair.
Ephemeral Encryption: All sensitive data exchanged between the user and the website is encrypted using short-lived keys that are valid only for a small window of time or a specific number of requests.
2. Dynamic HTML and JavaScript Obfuscation:
The algorithm changes the structure of HTML elements and JavaScript code on each page load. This includes renaming variables, rearranging code logic, and altering DOM structures without changing functionality. This makes it much harder for attackers to use static code analysis to detect vulnerabilities like XSS or CSRF.
Example: Form fields like username and password are renamed or reordered in the DOM with every session or request, preventing bots or attackers from relying on predictable element IDs or form structures.
3. Real-Time Threat Detection:
Machine Learning-Based Detection: The algorithm constantly monitors traffic patterns, user interactions, and requests for anomalies (e.g., sudden spikes in login attempts, unusual traffic from a single IP). If suspicious behavior is detected, the algorithm adapts by changing the security infrastructure, such as rotating keys, resetting sessions, or challenging the user with enhanced authentication.
Attack Signatures and Anomaly Responses: If an attack signature (e.g., SQL injection attempts or XSS payloads) is detected, the algorithm responds by immediately reconfiguring the affected sections of the website (e.g., refreshing all tokens, altering HTML/JS structures) and can temporarily block the suspicious user.
4. Context-Aware Session Management:
Session Tokens and Cookies: Instead of static session tokens or cookies, DPWSA regularly changes session identifiers based on user behavior (e.g., IP address, device type, interaction speed). This approach helps prevent session hijacking or token reuse attacks. Even if an attacker gains access to a session token, it becomes invalid after a brief period of inactivity or if used from a different IP or device.
Device and Location Awareness: The algorithm monitors user locations and device profiles, and if any inconsistency is detected (e.g., a sudden change in IP or device), the session is immediately invalidated, and the user is required to re-authenticate.
5. Polymorphic CAPTCHA:
The CAPTCHA mechanism used by the website evolves based on user interaction. If a bot is suspected, a more complex and personalized CAPTCHA is triggered, while trusted users get simpler challenges. The CAPTCHAs change dynamically based on feedback, adapting to challenge bots more effectively.
Example: The CAPTCHA challenge may shift from image-based to logic-based questions based on the behavior of the user or bot patterns detected by the system.
6. Adaptive Password Hashing:
Dynamic Hashing Algorithms: Passwords are hashed using a constantly evolving hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2), and the hashing mechanism is updated based on usage patterns or the detection of potential threats. Each password’s salt is also dynamically altered with each update.
If a potential attack on the password database is detected, the algorithm rehashes all stored passwords using new salts and algorithms, rendering any stolen password hashes obsolete.
7. AI-Driven Authentication and Multi-Factor Integration:
The algorithm applies machine learning to analyze user behavior, login patterns, and device fingerprints. If it detects anomalies (e.g., a login from an unexpected device), it activates enhanced authentication measures (e.g., multi-factor authentication, additional security questions, or dynamic CAPTCHAs).
Dynamic Multi-Factor Authentication: Based on the level of detected risk, the system adjusts the difficulty of the authentication challenge in real time. For example, if the user is logging in from a new device, it might trigger SMS or email-based authentication as an extra layer.
Use Cases:
E-Commerce Websites: Protects payment and personal information from SQL injections, XSS, and session hijacking by continuously updating encryption keys and session tokens. DPWSA ensures that even if an attacker intercepts a session, the information becomes useless quickly.
Banking and Financial Platforms: By dynamically adapting password hashing techniques and continuously rotating encryption keys, DPWSA protects against brute force attacks, credential stuffing, and session hijacking, providing an additional layer of security for sensitive financial data.
SaaS Platforms: In software-as-a-service platforms where multiple users collaborate, DPWSA protects login sessions and sensitive data exchange by detecting anomalies and adjusting authentication and encryption methods in real time.
Social Media and Forums: Prevents XSS and script injection attacks by dynamically changing HTML structure and JavaScript, making it difficult for attackers to insert malicious scripts.

Explanation:
Polymorphic Encryption Key Generation: This section uses RSA encryption to rotate the public/private keypair dynamically at specific intervals.
Session Token Rotation: Session tokens are periodically rotated based on user activity or detected anomalies to prevent session hijacking.
Adaptive CAPTCHA: A basic polymorphic CAPTCHA generator that changes the type of challenge each time it is generated, making it more difficult for bots.
Anomaly Detection: Basic rule-based anomaly detection for suspicious IPs and locations. If anomalies are detected, the algorithm triggers additional security steps like rotating session tokens or challenging the user with more complex CAPTCHAs.
Customization Options:
Advanced Threat Detection: Integrate more sophisticated machine learning models for detecting complex attacks (e.g., slow brute force attempts, multi-step SQL injections).
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Automatically trigger MFA when an anomaly is detected (e.g., requiring users to verify login through SMS or email).
Behavior-Based Authentication: Continuously authenticate users based on behavioral biometrics (e.g., typing patterns, mouse movements) and adjust session management based on the user's behavior.
Use Cases:
Online Banking Platforms: Ensures user sessions are secure even if tokens or credentials are intercepted, thanks to dynamic session management and adaptive authentication measures.
E-Commerce Websites: Protects against data breaches and man-in-the-middle attacks by rotating encryption keys and dynamically changing HTML structures, preventing the exploitation of static vulnerabilities.
High-Security SaaS Platforms: Prevents brute force and SQL injection attacks using real-time threat detection and anomaly-based responses, with added protection from adaptive hashing and session management.
Conclusion:
The Dynamic Polymorphic Web Security Algorithm (DPWSA), authored by Benjamin Hunter Miller, represents a modern and adaptive approach to web security. By dynamically altering encryption keys, session tokens, HTML structures, and CAPTCHA challenges, it ensures that attackers cannot rely on static vulnerabilities. DPWSA is ideal for websites that handle sensitive data, like e-commerce, financial platforms, and SaaS products, providing robust, adaptive, and polymorphic security.
