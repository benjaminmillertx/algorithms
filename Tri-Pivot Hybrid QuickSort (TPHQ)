Algorithm Name: Tri-Pivot Hybrid QuickSort (TPHQ)
Creator: Benjamin Hunter Miller

Description:
Tri-Pivot Hybrid QuickSort (TPHQ) is an innovative sorting algorithm that builds on the traditional QuickSort, but instead of a single or dual pivot, it uses three pivots to divide the array into four partitions. This division allows for more balanced partitions, reducing the depth of recursion and improving the efficiency of the sort. Furthermore, TPHQ hybridizes with Insertion Sort for small subarrays, leveraging its simplicity and speed for handling smaller datasets.

This algorithm is ideal for sorting large datasets, combining the advantages of QuickSort’s divide-and-conquer approach with the efficiency of Insertion Sort for small arrays. It is highly effective for systems with multi-core processors, where it can also be easily parallelized for additional performance gains.

Key Features:
Triple-Pivot Partitioning: Uses three pivots to divide the array into four segments, reducing the chance of uneven partitions and improving overall sorting speed.
Hybrid Insertion Sort: For small subarrays (below a certain threshold), TPHQ switches to Insertion Sort, which is faster for small datasets.
Efficient Memory Use: Like QuickSort, TPHQ operates in-place, requiring only a small amount of additional memory, making it very space-efficient.
Reduced Recursion Depth: Dividing the array into four parts instead of two minimizes the depth of recursion, reducing the total number of recursive calls.
Parallelism Friendly: The multiple partitions enable easy parallelization on multi-core processors, where each partition can be sorted independently.
How It Works:
1. Tri-Pivot Selection:
The algorithm selects three pivots from the array. These pivots divide the array into four regions:

Elements less than the lowest pivot.
Elements between the lowest and middle pivot.
Elements between the middle and highest pivot.
Elements greater than the highest pivot.
2. Partitioning:
The array is partitioned into four subarrays, based on the values relative to the three pivots. This approach significantly improves the balance of the partitions compared to traditional QuickSort.

3. Recursive Sorting:
The algorithm recursively sorts each of the four partitions. When a partition’s size falls below a certain threshold, it switches to Insertion Sort to minimize overhead from recursion and improve performance on small datasets.

4. Base Case Handling:
As the partitions shrink, the algorithm eventually hits a base case where the partitions are small enough to be sorted efficiently with Insertion Sort. This hybrid approach optimizes the handling of small subarrays.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n log n) (when partitions are evenly balanced)
Average Case: O(n log n) (expected behavior for random input)
Worst Case: O(n log n) (even in unbalanced scenarios, the multiple pivots help avoid worst-case quadratic behavior)
Space Complexity: O(log n) (due to recursion, but in-place memory use)

Explanation:
Insertion Sort: The function insertion_sort is used to sort small subarrays when the size of the partition falls below a threshold (in this case, 10).
Tri-Pivot Partitioning: The tri_pivot_partition function selects three pivots, partitions the array into four sections, and places the pivots in their correct positions.
Recursive Sorting: The tri_pivot_quick_sort function recursively sorts each of the four partitions. It switches to insertion sort for small partitions to optimize performance.
Entry Point: The tri_pivot_hybrid_sort function provides the entry point to sorting an array using TPHQ.
Advantages of TPHQ:
Improved Partitioning: By using three pivots, the algorithm creates four partitions, leading to better load balancing during recursion and reducing the overall depth of recursion.
Fast for Small Arrays: The use of Insertion Sort for small subarrays reduces the overhead of recursion and improves performance, particularly for small or partially sorted arrays.
Parallelism Friendly: The four partitions can be sorted independently, making the algorithm easy to parallelize on multi-core processors.
Reduced Worst-Case Scenarios: The three pivots help reduce the chances of worst-case partitioning, which is a common issue with single-pivot QuickSort.
Use Cases:
Large-Scale Data Sorting: The algorithm is ideal for sorting large datasets where performance is crucial, such as database indexing or big data processing.
Systems with Multi-Core Processors: TPHQ’s structure naturally lends itself to parallelization, making it perfect for systems that require fast, multi-threaded sorting.
General-Purpose Sorting: It can replace traditional QuickSort or MergeSort implementations for any system where in-place sorting with low overhead is needed.
Conclusion:
The Tri-Pivot Hybrid QuickSort (TPHQ) algorithm, designed by Benjamin Hunter Miller, offers a new, efficient approach to sorting by using a three-pivot partitioning technique combined with hybrid Insertion Sort. By improving partitioning efficiency and minimizing recursion depth, TPHQ outperforms traditional QuickSort on large datasets while maintaining in-place sorting and low memory overhead. Its adaptability to multi-core processing makes it an excellent choice for modern applications requiring fast, scalable sorting solutions.
