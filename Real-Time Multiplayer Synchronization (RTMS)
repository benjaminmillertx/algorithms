Algorithm Name: Real-Time Multiplayer Synchronization (RTMS)
Creator: Benjamin Hunter Miller

Description:
The Real-Time Multiplayer Synchronization (RTMS) algorithm is designed to efficiently synchronize player states, positions, and actions across a multiplayer game session in Unity. It ensures that all players in a networked game see consistent world states while minimizing latency and data transmission. The algorithm prioritizes bandwidth optimization by sending only the necessary data and utilizing techniques like interpolation and prediction to smooth out gameplay for all clients.

This system can be applied to real-time multiplayer games, such as first-person shooters (FPS), racing games, battle royale games, or cooperative experiences where accurate and synchronized player movement and interactions are critical.

Key Features:
Position and Rotation Synchronization: Synchronizes player positions, rotations, and movement smoothly between clients and the server.
Action/Event Synchronization: Synchronizes player actions (such as shooting, jumping, interacting with objects) across all players in real-time.
State Interpolation: Uses interpolation to smooth out position updates and reduce visible lag, ensuring players see smooth, consistent movements.
Client-Side Prediction: Uses prediction to guess the next state of a player based on their last known movement, reducing the perception of lag or jitter.
Bandwidth Optimization: Sends only necessary data over the network, compressing data where possible and sending updates at an optimal rate (e.g., sending positions only when they change significantly).
Authority Management: The algorithm handles which players or the server have authority over specific actions, ensuring only one source of truth for critical game states.
How It Works:
Client-to-Server Updates: Each player sends their inputs (e.g., movement, shooting) to the server at regular intervals. This data includes position, rotation, and any relevant actions (e.g., firing a weapon).

Server Validation and Broadcasting: The server validates these inputs to prevent cheating (e.g., teleporting) and sends the validated state to all connected clients. This includes the player's new position, rotation, and actions.

Client-Side Prediction: While waiting for the server to respond, clients predict the player's movement based on the current inputs (e.g., continuing forward if the player is holding the forward key).

State Interpolation: When a new state arrives from the server, the client uses interpolation to gradually adjust the predicted position to match the server's authoritative state, ensuring smooth transitions and avoiding jitter.

Action Synchronization: When a player performs an action (e.g., shooting or opening a door), the action is immediately displayed locally, but the server also validates and synchronizes this action across all clients to ensure consistency.

Lag Compensation: The algorithm includes lag compensation, ensuring that player actions, such as hitscan weapons or interactions, are accurately registered even if there's some network delay.

Use Cases:
First-Person Shooters (FPS): Ensures smooth synchronization of player movement, shooting, and interactions in fast-paced online games like Call of Duty or Counter-Strike.
Racing Games: Syncs player car positions and actions in real-time, ensuring consistency across all clients in multiplayer races.
Cooperative Games: Synchronizes player interactions and states in real-time cooperative games, such as Left 4 Dead or Minecraft.
Battle Royale Games: Keeps player positions, inventory, and actions synchronized across large multiplayer sessions in battle royale games like Fortnite or PUBG.
Unity Implementation
Step 1: Set Up Unity Networking (Mirror)
For this algorithm, weâ€™ll use Mirror, a popular networking solution for Unity that simplifies multiplayer implementation. Install the Mirror package from the Unity Asset Store or GitHub.

Create Networked Player Prefab: Create a player prefab with a NetworkIdentity component and add a movement script to control the player.
Set Up Network Manager: Add a NetworkManager component to an empty GameObject, which handles networked sessions (hosting, joining, etc.).
Step 2: Script for Real-Time Multiplayer Synchronization

public class PlayerController : NetworkBehaviour
{
    public float moveSpeed = 5f;
    public float turnSpeed = 300f;

    private Vector3 lastPosition;
    private Quaternion lastRotation;

    void Update()
    {
        // Only allow movement for the local player
        if (!isLocalPlayer) return;

        HandleMovement();
        HandleRotation();

        // Send movement updates to the server
        if (HasMoved())
        {
            CmdSendMovement(transform.position, transform.rotation);
        }
    }

    void HandleMovement()
    {
        float moveInput = Input.GetAxis("Vertical") * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
        transform.Translate(Vector3.forward * moveInput);
    }

    void HandleRotation()
    {
        float turnInput = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal") * turnSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
        transform.Rotate(Vector3.up, turnInput);
    }

    // Check if player has moved or rotated enough to warrant an update
    bool HasMoved()
    {
        return Vector3.Distance(transform.position, lastPosition) > 0.1f ||
               Quaternion.Angle(transform.rotation, lastRotation) > 1f;
    }

    // Command to send movement data to the server
    [Command]
    void CmdSendMovement(Vector3 newPosition, Quaternion newRotation)
    {
        // Server updates the player's position and rotation
        RpcSyncMovement(newPosition, newRotation);
    }

    // Client RPC to update all clients with the new position and rotation
    [ClientRpc]
    void RpcSyncMovement(Vector3 newPosition, Quaternion newRotation)
    {
        // Smoothly interpolate to the new position and rotation
        if (!isLocalPlayer)
        {
            StartCoroutine(SmoothMovement(newPosition, newRotation));
        }

        lastPosition = newPosition;
        lastRotation = newRotation;
    }

    // Smoothly interpolate player position and rotation to prevent "jitter"
    System.Collections.IEnumerator SmoothMovement(Vector3 targetPosition, Quaternion targetRotation)
    {
        float elapsedTime = 0f;
        float duration = 0.1f; // Time to smooth the movement

        Vector3 startingPosition = transform.position;
        Quaternion startingRotation = transform.rotation;

        while (elapsedTime < duration)
        {
            transform.position = Vector3.Lerp(startingPosition, targetPosition, (elapsedTime / duration));
            transform.rotation = Quaternion.Lerp(startingRotation, targetRotation, (elapsedTime / duration));
            elapsedTime += Time.deltaTime;

            yield return null;
        }

        transform.position = targetPosition;
        transform.rotation = targetRotation;
    }
}
Explanation:
Local Player Control: The PlayerController script ensures that only the local player can control movement and rotation using Unity's Input system.
Command and ClientRPC: The algorithm uses [Command] to send movement data from the client to the server (CmdSendMovement). The server then validates and broadcasts this movement to all other clients using [ClientRpc] (RpcSyncMovement).
Interpolation for Smooth Movement: The SmoothMovement() method interpolates the position and rotation of non-local players to reduce "jitter" or teleporting effects. This method uses Vector3.Lerp and Quaternion.Lerp for smooth transitions.
Optimized Updates: The system only sends movement updates when the player's position or rotation changes beyond a threshold (HasMoved()), reducing unnecessary network traffic.
Step 3: Network Setup
Network Identity: Make sure each player prefab has a NetworkIdentity component, and it's marked as "LocalPlayer".
Network Manager: Set up the NetworkManager to spawn the player prefab when a client connects to the server.
Customization Options:
Prediction and Lag Compensation: Implement client-side prediction by predicting the next state of the player when input is received. If the server disagrees with the predicted state, use interpolation to correct the player's position smoothly.

Action Synchronization: Extend the script to handle other synchronized actions like firing weapons, interacting with objects, or using abilities. Use Commands and ClientRPCs to ensure all clients receive updates about these actions.

Bandwidth Optimization: For high-performance games, further optimize the algorithm by sending data only when necessary, compressing data, and using delta compression (sending only the changes instead of full states).

Event Synchronization: Add event synchronization for things like item pickups, door interactions, and environmental changes, ensuring all players see the same world state.

Use Case in Games:
First-Person Shooter: In a fast-paced FPS like Call of Duty, RTMS can synchronize player movement, shooting, and hit detection across all clients, minimizing lag and ensuring smooth gameplay.
Racing Game: In a multiplayer racing game like Mario Kart, the algorithm can keep track of car positions, speed, and power-ups, broadcasting changes in real time to prevent desynchronization.
Cooperative Survival Game: In a survival game like Rust or DayZ, RTMS ensures that player interactions with the environment (e.g., chopping down trees, building) are synchronized across all players.
Conclusion:
The Real-Time Multiplayer Synchronization (RTMS) algorithm, authored by Benjamin Hunter Miller, provides an efficient and scalable way to synchronize player actions and states in real-time multiplayer Unity games. It balances smooth gameplay with bandwidth efficiency, using techniques like interpolation and prediction to minimize latency and jitter. This algorithm is ideal for any real-time multiplayer game, from first-person shooters to racing games, ensuring consistent gameplay across all connected players.
